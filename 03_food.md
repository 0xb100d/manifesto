# Food

sustainable, organic, good

A pescatarian society is the society for we.
A vegetarian diet is wise you'll see.

## seafood

Sustainably sourced seafood will be the staple.

This means somehow getting the water clean...

A micro-ecosystem will be created under the colony.  Here we will be able to source fish and sea-vegetables

## landfood
We'll also grow land based food on the floating islands or even in micro-farms inside individuals seasteads.
