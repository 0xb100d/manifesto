# Safety

protection from rogue waves, hurricanes, and other threats is vital to the survival of our dream and ourselves.

## from the sea
to protect the colony, an artificial beach will be constructed.

we should devise another method. there should never be just one layer of protection.

## from humans
I wish we didn't have to think about this, but we do.  Humans may attack.  Humans may invade.  Humans may pillage.  

How do we protect from this?
