# Water

drinkable seawater is the key.  desalination to the rescue.
electrolis? maybe, hydrogen is fun...
uncontained explosions...not so much.

## nanotech
graphene oxide is a useful way to filter seawater.  I would integrate this into the OTEC process if possible.

## electrolis
this is really expensive energy wise, but hey, if the power is "free" why not make water from hydrogen fuel cells?

## alternatives?
please propose more!
